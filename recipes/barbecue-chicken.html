        <li>Place the chicken in the air fryer skin side up and cook at 375 degrees F

        <li>Transfer the thighs to a bowl and toss in bbq sauce, making sure to coat each piece of chicken.</li>
        <li>Place back in the air fryer and continue cooking at 375 degrees F for an additional 5-7 minutes
