    <p class="content">Here's a super easy egg fried rice that you can prep and cook in 10 minutes, 
       featuring tender eggs with crispy rice simply seasoned with scallions and salt.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>You only need a few ingredients for egg fried rice:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Day-old rice</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of vegetable oil</li>
        <li>4 eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>4 green onions, sliced</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt (or to taste) </li>
        <li>Optional: for extra flavor, you can add chicken bouillon or MSG</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Equipment</h3>
    <ul><li>a large skillet</li></ul>
    <h3>What is day-old rice?</h3>
    <p>You might see "day-old rice", "overnight rice", or "leftover rice" for fried rice recipes. 
        It means you should use rice that is not freshly cooked, which is hot and sticky. 
        Overnight rice is a bit druid out, so the grains separate easily during cooking. 
        Freshly cooked rice tends to get mushy and clump together when made into a fried rice.
    </p>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p>To make egg fried rice:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oil over medium-high heat until hot and pour in the beaten eggs.</li>
        <li>Wait until the bottom sets and scramble lightly.</li>
        <li>Add the rice when the eggs are mostly set but partially runny.</li>
        <li>Cook and stir to chop the eggs into smaller bits.</li>
        <li>Add the green onion and salt to taste, stirring to thoroughly incorporate flavors.</li>
        <li>When all ingredients are combined thoroughly, toast the rice by letting it sit without stirring.</li>
        <li>Transfer everything to a plate, and serve hot!</li>
    </ol>
