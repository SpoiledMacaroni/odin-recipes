    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Prep Work</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine the cheese filling ingredients in a medium bowl and set aside.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Make the Meat Sauce</hS3>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Heat olive oil</b> over medium heat and <b>add the diced onions.</b>
        Let them soften for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li><b>Add the ground beef and sausage</b> and increase heat to medium-
        high. Use a spatula to break up the meat so that it's very fine and
        crumbled. Cook for 8-10 minutes, or until cooked through. <b>Add garlic</b> during the last minute.
        Drain excess grease.</li>
        <li><b>Add the chicken broth</b> and use a silicone spatula to "clean" the bottom and sides of the pot.
        <b>Add the marinara sauce, tomato paste, hot sauce, and Worcestershire sauce.</b> 
        Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Cover partially and let the sauce simmer gently.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Preheat Oven and Cook the Lasagna Noodles</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375.</li>
        <li><b>Begin boiling a large pot of salted pasta water</b> for the lasagna noodles. 
        Once a rapid boil is reached, <b>cook the noodles to al dente</b> according to package instructions. 
        Gently stir with a wooden spoon throughout cooking to prevent the noodles from sticking. 
        <b>Drain and rise with cold water</b> until noodles are completely cool.</li>
        <li>Lay the cooled noodles flat on wax or parchment paper while you begin assembling the lasagna.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Assemble</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Spread 1 cup of meat sauce</b> on the bottom of a 9x13-inch casserole dish. Next, <b>add 4 lasagna noodles</b>, overlapping them if needed.</li>
        <li><b>Spread 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture</b> over the noodles, followed by about <b>1.5 cups of meat sauce</b></li>
        <li>Top with <b>4 more lasagna noodles, 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture, and 1.5 cups meat sauce.</b></li>
        <li>Finish with <b>4 more lasagna noodles, the rest of the ricotta mixture, and the rest of the meat sauce.</b></li>
        <li><b>Top with 2.5 cups of mozzarella cheese.</b></li>
        <li><b>Spray foil with nonstick cooking spray</b> and place it spray-side-down on top of the baking dish to prevent the cheese from sticking to it.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Bake</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Bake for 35 minutes.</b> <em>Remove cover</em> and <b>bake for 10 more minutes.</b></li>
        <li>Remove and garnish with fresh parsley. <b>Let it sit for 15 minutes prior to serving</b> to allow the layers to set.</li>
    </ol>
